      Basic rules
    </h2>
    <p>
      The game is similar to a smaller version of ludo.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have seven pieces, you want to get your pieces on and around the track to the finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle section is common ground meaning you can remove opponent pieces, or they can remove your pieces when you land on opposing pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of special squares, one is for a reroll and the other is where your piece cannot be removed, and an opposing piece simply moves to the next square.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dice roll is a set of 4 D4\'s, tetrahedrons, where each has 2 out of 4 white points, where if a white point is sitting up, it counts as a move. For the purposes of this version, the math is the same under the hood, but I just output the move counter and available moves.
    </p>
    <p>
      First to 7 points wins!

      This was a nice side project, but I\'d really like to add the following
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Better graphics and images which more accurate reflect the game board
      </li>
      <li>
        Better animations, 3D, dice rolls
      </li>
      <li>
        Game chat
      </li>
      <li>
        Game names
      </li>
      <li>
        Mobile support
      </li>
      <li>
        So much more!
